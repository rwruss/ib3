// Process a player leaving a city
/*
 - The player will keep his normal city ID but that city will be removed from the parent city (if there is one).
 - A resource cart unit will be created that will link the city items that are being transported.  This can be moved to a new location and settled as a new city (process a task)
 - Any non-transferrable builindgs are left behind at the old city (or a ruin locaiton) to decay
